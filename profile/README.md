## 🎮 What Are Terraria Cheats?

Terraria cheats are tools, mods, and scripts that bend the game rules in your favor. From flying across maps to summoning rare bosses instantly, these hacks can give you god mode, infinite health, all items, spawn controls, and way more. They’re mostly used on the PC version via third-party mods, launchers, and save editors.

No more dying to a pesky Eye of Cthulhu or endlessly mining for that last ore chunk. It’s all yours – instantly.
